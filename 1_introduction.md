Hirna Regional veterinary Laboratory had been stablished with the objectives supporting field animal health service through diagnostic support and diagnostic capacity building, disease outbreak investigation and occurrence by time and place with its determinants &amp; magnitude will be studied, as well as reported monthly through **_AU-IBAR/OIE_** passive surveillance form from its operational areas.

With all this, activities under taken for the past one and haft decade Hirna Regional Veterinary Laboratory had been serving as a source of reliable animal health information in its mandate area.

To come up with disease outbreak distribution, frequencies and the magnitudes of its effect in particular area had studied and recorded. Whereas previously Vaccinations used to deliver in the face of outbreaks rather than strategically designed to prevent outbreaks and Implementation of control policies and strategies mainly monitored in terms of the number of vaccinations achieved, and not by monitoring impact on the disease targeted for control or eradication.

Hirna laboratory therefore as apart taker for the achievement of GTP **II** goals in livestock health sector had set strategic objectives, actions needed to dramatically strengthen the **GTP II** goals by **_2025._** (i.e.) _Strengthen and support establishment of innovative animal health field services and diagnostic capacity and quality management system of national and regional veterinary laboratories to enhance disease_ _prevention, control and_ value chains addition along livestock. This in turn will provides a readymade guide to the drafting of a focused and harmonized livestock vaccination calendar _(Disease Mapping)_ framework that will enable, if adopted, It is expected that from the, national policy framework regional livestock policies could be drawn for implementing sector-wide livestock development, paying attention to the diversity of _agro-ecological_ Conditions under which livestock resources are produced and traded.

This will enable effective integration Moreover, harmonized implementation. Therefore, the objective of having livestock vaccination calendar _(Disease Mapping_) framework is:

*   To make a significant contribution to the national, intercontinental and Global future and ever enlarging demand for animal source foods
*   To rapidly increase population (herd) immunity in the setting of an existing or potential outbreak, thereby limiting the morbidity and mortality that might
*   To make Implementation of control policies and strategies mainly monitored in terms of impact on the disease targeted for control or eradication.
*   Quality veterinary vaccines used strategically can and should be part of government sanctioned-programmers

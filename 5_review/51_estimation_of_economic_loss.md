## _5.1 Estimation of Economic loss_ {#5-1-estimation-of-economic-loss}

Mastitis, inflammation of the mammary gland, is a highly prevalent problem in dairy cattle and is one of the most important problem threats affecting the dairy industry. Financial loss will be; as a result of permanent loss of production in individual cows, discarded milk following antibiotic therapy, early culling of cows, veterinary and drug cost, increased labor, death of per acute cases, replacement costs and high leukocyte count are losses caused by the disease.

Estimation of milk production entails three components, namely number of milking cows, number of months milking cows actually milked within the reference period and average milk production per cow per day. This economic analysis is done based on (CSA, 2003) and the estimated number of milking cows, average daily milk production per cow and average lactation period per cow for each individual woreda is taken from the indicated source. Based on this in our area of survey the economic loss before and after the implementation of the result is estimated roughly as indicated in the **table 9, 10 and 11** below respectively.

Although some researchers reported that a quarter with mastitis loss an average of 17.2% of its milk production, as a disease form, both acute and chronic form of mastitis can cause permanent udder damage unless treated early at subclinical stage. Hence, this financial loss is estimated based on the above concept. The cost that could be possibly paid for inframammary infusion _(lactaclox, milking cow therapy)_ during the treatment also considered even if there are some costs as far as the whole activity is concerned.

Upon the analysis, if the implementation activity covers all the PA’s of the wereda, prior to implementation program a loss of **42, 415, 237 ETB** will be made from the 4 woreda’s. Meanwhile after a better implementation program this could be reduced to **12, 871, 728 ETB**.However to come up with the end result for treatment of _mastitic_ quarters **1, 802, 921.5 ETB** would be charged.

Hence, if thise activity is to be implemented all in all in all the PA’s of the wereda, after deducing the treatment cost that could be possible charged, in 4 weredas it could be possible to achive a difference of **28, 260, 586.5** ETB per annum. Morover, if this activity is to be applied for the rest woreda’s of its operational area, an estimate of about **233, 149, 838.6 ETB** will be obtained annually by only combating mastitis case in the area.

In conculussion, most of the isolates from mastitis case were pathogenic micoorganisms that could have a zoonotic impact to the health of humans when raw milk is consumed. Since, this activity would have such a positive impact in supplaying healthy and wholesome milk to the society; it should must continue in the rest of the woreda’s in the operational area.

Although thise activity has great financial output, the regional agency office is not allocating enough budgets that enable us to run the activity in at list half of the weredas exist in the operational area. Thus in order to increase the livestock product and productivity, the regional agency office should give a special attention by considering the difficulty of the implementation activity. Besides the regional agency office should be in line with the laboratory in order to execute the implementation activity, by renovating special order from the top to the bottom animal health concerning bodies

As we understand from the above table prevalence and distribution of helminthes parasites of ovine and caprine were significantly decreased after survey output implementation work. This means the production and productivity of the animals were increased. The overall prevalence of:

*   ovine helmith parasite of Doba Woreda decreased from **33.1 to 17.2** after implementation
*   caprine helmith parasite of Doba Woreda decreased from **24.3 to 20.6** after implementation
*   ovine helmith parasite of Haromaya Woreda decreased from **89.7 to 40.0** after implementation
*   caprine helmith parasite of Haromaya Woreda decreased from **95.4 to 54.**2 after implementation
*   ovine helmith parasite of Meta Woreda decreased from **95.2 to 53.6** after implementation
*   caprine helmith parasite of Meta Woreda decreased from **63.5 to 43.1** after implementation
*   ovine helmith parasite of Kersa Woreda decreased from **82.5 to 57.1** after implementation
*   caprine helmith parasite of Kersa Woreda decreased from **78.4 to 34.6** after implementation

**Estimation of losses of body weight by internal parasite before and after implementation program of sheep and goat of selected woreda**

The majority of indigenous sheep and goats from extensive management are marketed at average live weight of 25Kg which have mean dressing percentage of 50%. (Alemu Yami&amp; R.C. Markel, 2008; sheep and goat production handbook for Ethiopia). The current sheep and goat meat prices are 180 birr/Kg. In highland and mid highland Ethiopia sheep and goat body losses due to endoparasitism ranged from 6-10% and average 8% (Teklay. B, Mukosa. E, and SCHOLTENS. R.C. 1987; Seasonal changes in nematodes egg count in Ethiopia). This means in average helminthes parasite losses 1kg of meat from sheep and goats per animal.

**Estimation of losses by death of sheep and goats due to internal parasites, before and after implementations program in selected woredas.**

. In Ethiopia, helminthosis is responsible for 25% mortality in highland and midland sheep and goat (Ngategize et al., 1993). Naw a days in average single sheep or goat is marketing about 500 ETB.When we analysis this to money;

On estimation analysis only by decreased body weights and Mortalty rate due to Helmenth parasites of sheep and goat to money before implementation program loss of **39,411,900 ETB and 27,369,000 ETb** were made from the four selected woredas respectivily. Meanwhile after better implementation program this could be reduced to **23,391,000 ETB in decreasing body weight** **and 16,243,500 ETB in mortality.** Hence, due to the effort made by the laboratory survey result output implementation in selected woredas it has achieved about **27,146,400 ETB by** decreasing losses in body weigt and mortality due to helmenth parasite**.**

**Results of survey output implementation of sheep and goat of selected woreda**

At present internal parasite are mainly controlled by use of anthelmintic drug. Strategic deworming of the animals with approved drugs is an important strategy in controlling internal parasites. Based on this all selected woredas were used Albendazole and Ivermactin for the deworming activity.

As we understand from the above table prevalence and distribution of helminthes parasites of shoat were significantly decreased after survey output implementation work. This means the production and productivity of the animals were increased. The overall prevalence of shoat helmenth parasites of:

*   Haromaya Woreda decreased from **46.6 to 36.6** after implementation
*   Kersa Woreda decreased from **46.1 to 34.4** after implementation
*   Meta Woreda decreased from **48.7 to 43.9** after implementation
*   Gurawa Woreda decreased from **65.6 to 38.3** after implementation
*   Anchar Woreda decreased from **77.0 to 52.2** after implementation

**Estimation of losses of body weight by internal parasite before and after implementation program of sheep and goat of selected woreda**

The majority of indigenous sheep and goats from extensive management are marketed at average live weight of 25Kg which have mean dressing percentage of 50%. (Alemu Yami&amp; R.C. Markel, 2008; sheep and goat production handbook for Ethiopia). The current sheep and goat meat prices are 200 birr/Kg. In highland and mid highland Ethiopia sheep and goat body losses due to endoparasitism ranged from 6-10% and average 8% (Teklay. B, Mukosa. E, and SCHOLTENS. R.C. 1987; Seasonal changes in nematodes egg count in Ethiopia). This means in average helminthes parasite losses 1kg of meat from sheep and goats per animal.

**Estimation of losses by death of sheep and goats due to internal parasites, before and after implementations program in selected woredas.**

. In Ethiopia, helminthosis is responsible for 25% mortality in highland and midland sheep and goat (Ngategize et al., 1993). Naw a days in average single sheep or goat is marketing about 500 ETB.When we analysis this to money;

On estimation analysis only by decreased body weights and Mortalty rate due to Helmenth parasites of sheep and goat to money before implementation program loss of **34,281,800** **ETB and 21,426,000 ETb** were made from the five selected woredas respectivily. Meanwhile after better implementation program this could be reduced **20,096,800** to **ETB in decreasing body weight** **and 12,560,500 ETB in mortality.** Hence, due to the effort made by the laboratory survey result output implementation in selected woredas it has achieved about **23,050,500 ETB by** decreasing losses in body weigt and mortality due to helmenth parasite**.**

# **5 REVIEW** {#5-review}

In four of the wereda namely; Darolabu, Kombolcha, Meta and Odabultum the implementation activity was done satisfactorily and the result was also very exciting. At Boke wereda due to transportation and heavy rain problem the activity was not progressing with the program and there was a delay in reporting and screening the milking cows. However, all the rest had done based on the action plan.

As of our monitoring awareness creation among the cattle owners and agriculture extension agents in the surveyed areas about mastitis prevention measures was sufficiently accomplished in all the selected wereda. Those assigned veterinarians in the selected PA’s had moved over the area in a program manner, screened out milking cows and those positive cows were provided treatment for the third round as indicated from their report and upon our monitoring except that of Boke wereda (done only for the first round). In addition, the veterinarians on the site affirm that 75 to 82% of _sub-clinically mastitis_ cows had found treated.

In a PA’s were this implementation activity was conducted the team from the laboratory visited the area and tried to discuss some of the cattle owners for confirmation. The owners respond that, as they informed about mastitis control and prevention measures and as the screening program was done for the third round in all the weredas except owners of Boke wereda.

Finally, at the end of the year, a total of 1604 milk samples had collected from; Darolabu (274), Boke (300), _Kombolcha (368_), _Meta_ (329) and _Odabultum_ (333) wereda from 73, 79, 92, 83 and 86 cows of different PA respectively. In order to avoid false positive result due to the _colostrum_ in the early milking cows, only those cows after 15 days of parturition were sampled.

| Overall | **413** | **1604** | **48** | **53** | **12.8%** | **83** | **5.2%** | **55** |

As described on the table below, a mastitis prevalence rate of 26.6%, 16.4%, 10.9%, 7.0%, and 4.8% is obtained from Boke, Darolabu, Kombolcha, Odabultum, and Meta wereda from high rate to low prevalence respectively. Except that of Boke wereda, the implementation output evaluation result revealed a great variation when considered from the result exist before implementation activity, which was 40%, 31.2%, 20.0% and 24.0% at Darolabu, Kombolcha, Meta and Odabultum wereda respectively.

Up on cultural examination out of 83 quarters positive for CMT, 55 quarters revealed the presence of mastitis causing pathogen and _staphylococci aureus_ is found dominating the rest possible isolates (Table 8).

### Escherichia coli {#escherichia-coli}

 | 11 | 20.0 |
| 2 | _Klebsiella_ | 7 | 12.7 |
| 3 | _Staph. hycus_ | 5 | 9.1 |
| 4 | _Staph. intermidiuse_ | 6 | 10.9 |
| 5 | _Staph.areus_ | 16 | 29.1 |
| 6 | _Micrococci spps_ | 3 | 5.4 |
| 7 | _Staph. epidermidis_ | 3 | 5.4 |
| 8 | _Citrobacter_ | 1 | 1.8 |
| 9 | _Enterobacter_ | 3 | 5.4 |
|  | **_Total_** | **55** | **100.0** |

Due to the second time implementation program held at Kombolcha, Meta and Odabultum wereda, the prevalence rate is found greatly decreased unlike to the other two newly implemented wereda.

In general, the assigned veterinarians as well as the agency and the wereda administrative bodies were well integrated in implementing the action plan and thus the prevalence became more reduced at a great level. Therefore, this activity should be continued in the same approach to the rest PA’s of the woreda’s and as much as possible it is better to administer lactaclox intrammammary infusion for those cows with subclinical mastitis.
